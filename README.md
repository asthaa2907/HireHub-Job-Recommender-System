## How It Works

###  1. Resume Parsing  
Extracts text using PDFMiner / docx2txt → then extracts relevant skills.

###  2. TF-IDF Vectorization  
Creates a numerical representation of jobs and queries.

###  3. Content-Based Similarity  
Uses **Cosine Similarity** to match resume/query text to the job dataset.

###  4. Hybrid Scoring  
Final ranking =  
Hybrid Score = 0.7 * similarity + 0.3 * popularity


###  5. Voice Input  
Uses Web Speech API to let users search for jobs using voice commands.

###  6. Chatbot  
A guided chatbot to help users find jobs or understand platform features.
